# 🏠 Housing Price Classification using Logistic Regression

This project applies **Logistic Regression** to a housing dataset to classify whether a house is **high-priced** or not based on features like area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and stories.  
The model is trained on both **unscaled** and **scaled** data to compare performance and demonstrate the importance of feature scaling in classification problems.

## 📁 Dataset

- **File**: `Housing.csv`
- **Target Variable**: `HighPrice` (binary: 1 = high-priced, 0 = not high-priced)
- **Features Used**:
  - `area`
  - `bedrooms`
  - `bathrooms`
  - `stories`

> If `HighPrice` is not already binary, it is generated by comparing prices to the median:
> ```python
> df['HighPrice'] = (df['price'] > df['price'].median()).astype(int)
> ```

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

- **Model**: Logistic Regression (`scikit-learn`)
- **Scaler Used**: `StandardScaler` (for scaled version)
- **Data Split**: 80% training, 20% testing
- **Evaluation**:
  - Accuracy score
  - Classification report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)

## ⚖️ Model Performance: Scaled vs. Unscaled

| Metric                | Unscaled Model | Scaled Model |
|-----------------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Accuracy**          | 0.76           | 0.77         |
| **Precision (Class 0)** | 0.74         | 0.75         |
| **Recall (Class 0)**    | 0.92         | 0.91         |
| **F1-Score (Class 0)**  | 0.82         | 0.82         |
| **Precision (Class 1)** | 0.83         | 0.81         |
| **Recall (Class 1)**    | 0.53         | 0.58         |
| **F1-Score (Class 1)**  | 0.65         | 0.68         |
| **Macro Avg F1**        | 0.73         | 0.75         |
| **Weighted Avg F1**     | 0.75         | 0.76         |

> ✅ **Observation**: Scaling slightly improved overall performance and macro-average F1-score, particularly improving recall for high-priced properties (Class 1).
